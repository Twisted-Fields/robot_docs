# About

Our goal is to build a general purpose farming platform suitable to aid in every step of the farming process in a regenerative agriculture system.

Our system is open source and it is designed so it can be built in a small shop in any city in the world.

We hope this system will aid in a new generation of farming automation focused on regenerative organic agriculture.
