Welcome to Twisted Fields' documentation!
===================================

Twisted Fields creates Acorn, a farming robot build with our Precision Farming
Rover system. The PFR system and Acorn robot are open source, and comprised of
mechanical designs, printed circuit board designs, and software.


`Twisted Fields<https://www.twistedfields.com/>` is a research farm located in
San Gregorio, California, just outside of Silicon Valley and San Francisco.

Check out the :doc:`overview` section for an overview of how the system works.
