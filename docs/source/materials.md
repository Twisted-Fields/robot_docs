##### Drive Motor

$275.00  
This motor is generally pretty good, but it may not be weatherproof enough.
May need to order a custom motor, but suppliers we have contacted have not
wanted to make a motor with the high gear ratio reduction of this wheelbarrow
motor. Bafang requires a 500 piece order to custom make a motor. It may be possible
to convince Bafang that the world needs a robust electric farm robot wheel which
supports larger diameter tires, better weather sealing, and planetary gearing.
Or someone on the ground in China may be able to find a manufacturer which can
support our needs. So far efforts to do so over Alibaba have failed.

##### Tires

##### Steering Motor

\$300 - We no longer need the built-in encoder, so a cheaper weather sealed
motor should be found, or a non-sealed motor plus enclosure should be tested.

Something in the 60 RPM range similar to these \$45 aliexpress motors could be
viable:

Warning these shippers seem slow and unreliable. A reliable supplier would
need to be found, if testing showed the motors to be of acceptable performance.
These motors may be under powered - needs testing.
